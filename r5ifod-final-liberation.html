                            <p> By definition if no one returned from moksha, how is it possible to know that on the other side is eternal rest and freedom, and not something else or completely new and unimaginable. Trying to point this out because of this silly mechanics and ppl are still trying to run like hell in Ravana EX. Basically if you take no damage from the initial damage of prey in Final Liberation phase, you don't take any debuff at all. This means you won't die from second prey. Just let tanks go to designated area you wish them to take double prey and stoneskin + adlo them. Make sure they pop some cds so they take 0 damage from the first hit. There you go easy Ravana ex. (No need Hallowed. So, got the liberation mission series going in my starting province, and did well. All the way through the tower, no real issues. I beat that and my ADVENT strength is 4. Now, I have a few wounds on my A-Team, and the final liberation has no timer, so I decide to wait a bit to do it. Strength hits 5, so I decide it is time to go. 8 days for 100% infiltration, Swarming at base, not fun but hey, strength 5 won't be horrible if I am careful. I am now at 80% infiltration and Strength 9. I literally. As the title, I am curious if on the final liberation mission to assault the Advent HQ of a region, does Advent strength make an actual difference? The missions are always swarming, so its not like it will lower the number of troops, and with so many different Trooper options, I cannot see too many different aliens being added either. So if I assault a level 6 vs a level 2 region HQ, what, if any, differences are there? Thanks. 
If you were a fan of Final Liberation, Armageddon is an absolute. ##Operation Anatolia The situation remains unacceptable in Thrace, the Soviets reject a very generous peace deal. They will be evicted by all means possible. Newly consolidated MEDCOM will ensure of it. MEDCOM Supreme Command, made up of Libyan, Egyptian, Turkish, and Italian Field Marshals, Admirals, and Air Marshals, with all forces being under Libyan Command. --- ###Operation Star Shell (Air Campaign) Under coordination of MEDCOM Supreme Command, the air forces of the Mediterranean So I know how to do it (thanks to that very nice SNES style guide and info on here) but for some reason, even when everyone does it 'right', it doesn't ever seem to be 100% clean. Often, even if I'm never marked for prey and don't stand in the danger zones, I'll get hit anyway. I've been hit when moving right to the center after the prey swap and the purple circles come out. Hell, I've been hit with a purple circle on me and I'm sitting in the back of the arena nowhere near where the preys shoul. EDIT 2: Wrong strat, read comments. 
I also discovered an Ebay-auction were someone sells an installer that will install the game on a 64bit system. https://www.gog.com/news/weekly_staff_picks_warhammer_bundle Some great Warhammer classics for every lowend!. Abstract The Midwestern Federation's continued callous actions, lack of diplomacy, and defiance of the Treaty of New York City has forced the Eastern Confederacy of America to once again liberate the now unrecognized country. The missile strikes on military installations and losses sustained have done their job to a point. However the Midwestern government has seemed to not be phased at all by these actions, and failed to attend a peace talks in Saudi Arabia, and later stormed out after. So I keep seeing all these charts, and patterns for how to deal with final liberation, and while its all solid, the best and most reliable way Ive found to deal with it for clear party's farm party's, and everything in between is for both tanks to 2 hour the second strike and just take both prey strikes themselves, its less overall movement for the entire party, with no worrying about passing the prey aside to give it to the tanks initially. unfortunately I realize this kinda leaves Warriors. I tried looking for a Ravana ex cheat sheet similar to ones I've seen for Titan and Bismarck ( but I coudnt find one. So while waiting for my learning party to fill up I made one quickly: ~~The prettiest cheat-sheet ever~~ Lemme know if anything is inaccurate, I kinda just threw it together quickly based on a video and the wiki EDIT: While im at it allow me to advertise this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJeAXiC1IGE) brilliant guide to Final Liberation. </p>
